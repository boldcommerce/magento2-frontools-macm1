# Magento 2 Frontools for Mac M1
Set of front-end tools for Magento 2, based on Gulp.js

# Fork
This is a fork of the original [Snowdog Frontools module](https://github.com/SnowdogApps/magento2-frontools). Since that module is no longer maintained, it's not compatible with the latest Apple Mac M1/M2 chips. Mainly due to Node Sass and PhantomJS dependencies that are incompatable.

## Changes in this fork for version 1.7.3
* Node version 16 compatible
* Removed node-sass
* Removed gulp-svg-sprite due to dependency on phantomjs
* Updated lots of npm package versions
